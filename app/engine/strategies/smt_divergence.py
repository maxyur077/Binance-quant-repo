SMT Divergence Strategy (Smart Money Technique)

Ported from Azalyst-FundingPips-Signals. Adapted for Binance crypto.

Logic:
  Compares the current symbol's swing structure against BTC/USDT.
  
  Bearish SMT: BTC makes a Higher High, but the altcoin makes a Lower High
  -> SHORT the altcoin (it's showing relative weakness).

  Bullish SMT: BTC makes a Lower Low, but the altcoin makes a Higher Low
  -> LONG the altcoin (it's showing relative strength).

  The diverging pivot must be recent (within FRESH_BARS) to avoid stale signals.
  Uses swing detection with configurable strength.

NOTE: This strategy requires BTC data to compare against. The signal() function
uses only the current symbol's dataframe. The BTC comparison is done via the
swing highs/lows already present in the dataframe (local_swing_high/low).
Since we can't fetch BTC data inside a strategy, we approximate using the
symbol's own structure: we detect internal divergence between price making
new highs/lows and RSI/momentum failing to confirm (a structural proxy for
cross-asset divergence).
