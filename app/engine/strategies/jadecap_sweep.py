JadeCap Liquidity Sweep Strategy (Enhanced)

Ported from Azalyst-FundingPips-Signals. Adapted for Binance crypto on 15m candles.

Logic:
  1. Identify key liquidity levels: Previous Day High/Low (PDH/PDL) using 
     the last 96 bars (= 1 day of 15m candles).
  2. Detect a liquidity sweep: price pierces above/below the level in the 
     last few bars, then pulls back.
  3. Confirm the reversal with either:
     - A Fair Value Gap (FVG): 3 candle imbalance where candle 1's high < candle 3's low (bullish)
     - A Market Structure Shift (MSS): price breaks the recent opposite extreme
  4. Enter the trade against the sweep direction.

Direction: Both Long & Short.
