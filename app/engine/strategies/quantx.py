QUANT-X Multi-Agent Consensus Strategy

Ported from Azalyst-FundingPips-Signals. Adapted for Binance crypto on 15m candles.

Logic:
  4 virtual "agents" each vote BUY (+1), SELL (-1), or NEUTRAL (0):
    1. Market Agent: EMA 20/50 cross + MACD histogram direction
    2. Sentiment Agent: RSI position + price vs VWAP
    3. Liquidity Agent: Current volume vs 20-bar average (confirms participation)
    4. Risk Agent: ATR/price ratio blocks trades if volatility is extreme (>5%)

  A trade fires only when >= 3 agents agree on the same direction.
  SL = 1.5x ATR(14), TP = 3x ATR(14) -> 1:2 Risk/Reward.
